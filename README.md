# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-HAR
This project implements and compares two primary time series forecasting methods—SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and HAR (Heterogeneous Autoregressive) model—to forecast a synthetic hourly time series data exhibiting trend and multi-frequency seasonality (daily and weekly).
The core notebook, har (1).ipynb, details the process from synthetic data generation and model training to rolling backtesting and hierarchical reconciliation.
Key FeaturesSynthetic Data Generation: Creates a robust, synthetic hourly time series incorporating daily and weekly seasonal components, a long-term upward trend, and Gaussian noise for realistic simulation.
SARIMA Baseline: Implements an ARIMA/SARIMA model (using pmdarima.auto_arima for automated order selection when available) to serve as a forecasting baseline on the hourly series.HAR Model Implementation: Trains a linear regression model using Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) features, which are designed for multi-scale forecasting (e.g., hourly, daily, and weekly lagged means).The features used are:lag_1: Value from the previous hour ($t-1$).lag_24_mean: Mean value from the previous 24 hours (up to $t-1$).lag_168_mean: Mean value from the previous 7 days (168 hours, up to $t-1$).
Hierarchical Reconciliation: Explores time series reconciliation, specifically mentioning the Bottom-up proportional scaling method, to ensure consistency between the hourly forecast and its daily/weekly aggregates.Model Tuning and Evaluation: Includes implementation and tuning of advanced linear models like Ridge Regression and Huber Regression to improve the HAR model's robustness and performance. A rolling backtest methodology is used for robust out-of-sample evaluation.
DependenciesThe project uses common Python libraries for data manipulation, time series analysis, and machine learning. These can be installed using pip:Bash!pip install --quiet pmdarima shap matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn pandas
Required Libraries:pandasnumpymatplotlibscikit-learn (for Linear, Ridge, and Huber Regression models)statsmodelspmdarima (for automated ARIMA order selection)shap (for model interpretability, though not fully shown in output)
Getting StartedClone the Repository (Hypothetical):Bashgit clone 
cd [Time-Series-Forecasting-with-HAR]
Install Dependencies:Run the installation command above in your environment or the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook.Run the Notebook:Open har (1).ipynb in a Jupyter environment (like Google Colab, JupyterLab, or VS Code) and execute the cells sequentially. The notebook generates the synthetic data, trains the models, performs a rolling backtest, and outputs visualizations of the results, saving them to the /content/har_report_outputs directory.
Sample ResultsThe model training for the Linear Regression HAR model resulted in the following coefficients for the multi-scale features:FeatureCoefficientlag_1 (Previous Hour)0.9013lag_24_mean (Daily Mean)0.0638lag_168_mean (Weekly Mean)0.0346Intercept0.0448
